## Welcome!

I'm a 23 year old Computer Science major who is currently in his Junior year at Boise State University. I enjoy all types of things from sports, computers, math, and learning in general. I'm diverse in my skill set and always do my best to learn something new everyday. I enjoy challenges and pushing myself beyound my limits.

I'm currently seeking internships and positions that will help me challenge myself. I've just recently got into machine learning and data science which really exists me.

}
else if(eagles == lose
{
  System.out.println("I'm sad:(");
}
